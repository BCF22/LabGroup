The first step in the program is to create some questions formatted as strings. After which the program prompts the user to answer said questions.

Next we try to convert the input for age to an integer. The output that is printed is dependent on whether or not this conversion was successful. If the conversion from string to integer is successful, the program converts the human age into dog years and formats a string with the user's name for the output.

Finally the program prints the output from the previous step.

Here is an example output:
